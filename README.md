This project is a student progression tracker built using Python. It calculates and displays students' progression based on their pass, defer, and fail credits. The program features two modes: student and staff. In student mode, users can enter their credit data and see immediate results. Staff mode allows multiple entries, displays results in a histogram, and generates a detailed text file with the progression data. The histogram visualizes the distribution of progress, trailers, retrievers, and excluded students. This project demonstrates basic input validation, data processing, and graphical representation using the `graphics` library.
